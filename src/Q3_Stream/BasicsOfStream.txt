What it does :

SOURCE -> FILTER -> SORT -> MAP -> COLLECT

STREAM SOURCE : can come from an ARRAY, LIST, SETS, INT, LONGS, DOUBLE, Line of a file.

INTERMEDIATE OPERATIONS : such as filter, map or sort, this will return another stream. We can chain multiple intermediate operations.
Order of operation, FILTER FIRST then sort or map.
Other operations are, anyMatch(), distinct(), filter(), findFirst(), flatMap(), map(), skip(), and sorted().

TERMINAL OPERATIONS : such as forEach, collect or reduce, can return void, or a non-stream result.
forEach : applies to the same function of each element.
collect : saves the elements into a collection.
All other operations like, count(), max(), min(), reduce(), summaryStatistic() : reduces the stream to a single summary element.
